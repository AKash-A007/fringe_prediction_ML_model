I. Project Title:

Fringe Value Prediction in Photoelasticity Using Machine Learning
II. Motivation:

Photoelasticity is widely used in stress analysis for engineering applications. Predicting fringe values from RGB images can help automate stress analysis, reducing manual interpretation errors and improving efficiency. Machine learning models can provide accurate fringe predictions, enhancing real-time analysis.
III. Project Type:

Regression (Fringe values are continuous and must be predicted based on RGB inputs).

Expected Project Outcomes:

    Develop and compare regression models (Random Forest and CNN) for predicting fringe values.
    Evaluate the effectiveness of different models for structured and spatial data.
